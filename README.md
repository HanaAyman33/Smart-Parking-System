# Smart Parking System 🚗

An FPGA-based automated parking system designed to simulate real-world functionality using VHDL. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware components with FPGA logic to track car entries, detect motion, and display the total car count in a parking facility. The system leverages digital design principles to create an efficient and interactive parking solution.

## Features 🌟

- **Button-Controlled Gate:** Simulates gate opening and closing operations with a tactile button.  
- **Car Detection:** Employs an IR sensor to detect cars as they pass through the gate.  
- **Automatic Gate Closure:** Gate operation is managed seamlessly using an SG90 servo motor.  
- **Car Count Display:** Real-time car count is displayed on a 7-segment display for easy visualization.
