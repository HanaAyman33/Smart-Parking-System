# Smart Parking System  

An FPGA-based project implemented in VHDL to simulate an automated parking system. It tracks cars entering a gate, detects their presence, and displays the total car count.

## Features  
- **Button-Controlled Gate**: Simulates gate opening using a button.  
- **Car Detection**: Uses an IR sensor to detect when a car passes through the gate.  
- **Automatic Gate Closure**: The gate is managed by an SG90 servo motor.  
- **Car Count Display**: Total number of cars is displayed on a 7-segment display.
